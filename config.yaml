        description: "Describe makedeb's support for AUR PKGBUILDs"
        value: |
          makedeb does not, and will **never** support PKGBUILDs from the Arch User Repository.

          The PKGBUILDs on the AUR are intended for use by makepkg (the build tool on Arch Linux), which uses a different PKGBUILD spec than makedeb, creating potential problems between the two tools.
